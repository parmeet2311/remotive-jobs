## Overview

### User Stories

Users should be able to:

- User can see a list of jobs in a city by default
- User can search for jobs with a given keyword
- User can search for a full-time job only
- User can see a list of jobs with their logo, company name, location, and posted time.
- When user select a job, user can see job descriptions and how to apply like the given design.
- When user is on the job details page, user can go back to the search page
- User can see jobs on different pages, 5 items on each page

### Features

- App displays list of jobs
- App displays list of jobs according to the category specified
- App displays list of jobs according to the location specified

### How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash

# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Run the app
$ yarn dev
```

## My process

### Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Fullstack Framework
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - For HTTP requests
- [nextjs-progressbar](https://github.com/apal21/nextjs-progressbar) - A progress bar (loader), while switching switching pages
- [react-html-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-html-parser) - A utility for converting HTML strings into React components

### What I learned

I've learned lot of things in this challenge:

- How to use Redux toolkit for state management in nextjs

```js
// store/index.js
import { combineReducers, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { createWrapper, HYDRATE } from 'next-redux-wrapper';
import pagination from './pagination';
import jobs from './jobs';

const combinedReducer = combineReducers({
  pagination,
  jobs,
});

const masterReducer = (state, action) => {
  if (action.type === HYDRATE) {
    return {
      ...state,
      ...action.payload,
    };
  } else {
    return combinedReducer(state, action);
  }
};

const makeStore = () => {
  return configureStore({
    reducer: masterReducer,
  });
};

const wrapper = createWrapper(makeStore);
export { makeStore, wrapper };
```

```js
// pages/index.js
import { wrapper } from '../store';

export const getStaticProps = wrapper.getStaticProps((store) => async () => {
  const jobs = await getAllJobs();
  store.dispatch(setJobs(jobs));

  const categories = await getJobsCategories();
  store.dispatch(setCategories(categories));

  const locations = await getLocations();
  store.dispatch(setLocations(locations));

  store.dispatch(setSelectedCategory('all'));

  return {
    props: { jobs },
  };
});
```

- How to use getStaticPaths

```js
// pages/category/[category].js
export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  const categories = await getJobsCategories();
  return {
    paths: categories.map((category) => ({ params: { category } })),
    fallback: false,
  };
};
```

### Continued development

Technologies I'd be learning soon:

- Typescript
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Material UI
- Backend Development
- Blockchain Development
- Testing (JS)
- Flutter & Dart
- Cyber Security

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing reference which helped me finally understand detailed concepts like data- attr, aria attr, input range etc.
- [Nextjs Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) - Best reference to get start with Nextjs
- [Illustrations](https://storyset.com/) - Best illustrations for errors and warnings etc.
- [Logo/Icons](https://www.flaticon.com) - Flat Icons best place for free icons
